# Day 14 – Networking Fundamentals & Hands-on Checks

## 7 layers of OSI Model

**Physical Layer-layer 1**

**Physical Layer which is your router, laptop, lan cable. these are part of physical layer*

⬇️

**Data link layer-layer 2**

**Data link layer which is physical addressing, MAC address(media access controller)*

⬇️

**Network layer-layer 3**

**Network layer requests through packets(ip Add)*

⬇️

**Transport layer-layer 4**

**Transport layer transports packet using protocol(TCP/IP, UDP)*

⬇️

**Session layer-layer 5**

**Session layer maintains session and establish connection*

⬇️

**Presentation layer-Layer 6**

**Presentation layer checks security, ehecks encryption, data encoding.*

⬇️

**Application layer-layer 7**

**Application layer is the direct intreface between user and network. HTTP, HTTPS, DNS*

## TCP/IP model

**Network access layer-1**

**it is combination of physical layer and data link layer*

⬇️

**Internet layer - layer2**

**its same as netwrok layer, requests data through packets*

⬇️

**Transport layer- layer3**

its same as transprot layer which sends packet using protocol*

⬇️

**application layer- layer4**

**this is combination of session, presentation and application layer as it consider establishing connection,

encryption and security and app interface to be a part of application.*


# Hands-on Checklist (run these; add 1–2 line observations)

hostname -I- this shows my IP.

ping <target> - this command shows the packets loss and if the url is working.

traceroute <target> (or tracepath) - to see the route of internet and how it reaches this site.

sudo ss -tulpn (or netstat -tulpn) - to see ports open and service running on them

dig <domain> or nslookup <domain> — provides the ip of the application server.

curl -I <http/https-url> — this shows the status code for the site. 200, 405.

netstat -an | head — shoes which port is listening.


# Day 15 – Networking Concepts: DNS, IP, Subnets & Ports

## Task 1: DNS – How Names Become IPs.

**Explain in 3–4 lines: what happens when you type google.com in a browser?**

when we enter amazon.com in the browser it serches for any cache in browser or operating system if earlier visited the site. if it does not find any
it goes to the DNS resolver(one of the populer resolver is google(8.8.8.8)). DNS resolver send it to root server, root server finds its top level domain and sends it to TLD server,
TLD server sends it to specific server for Top level domain(.com,.in,.edu). TLd point it to authorization name server wher it gets the exact ip of the DNS and that goes to the 
user machine and user is able to access the website.


## What are these record types?

**The most common and foundational DNS record types include:**

A (Address) Record: The core record that points your domain or subdomain to a specific IPv4 address (e.g., 192.0.2.1).

AAAA (Quad-A) Record: Maps a hostname directly to a 128-bit IPv6 address (e.g., 2001:0db8::85a3) for newer network standards.

CNAME (Canonical Name) Record: Forwards an alias (e.g., www.example.com) to the actual canonical domain name instead of an IP address.

MX (Mail Exchange) Record: Directs incoming emails to the specific mail servers responsible for your domain's email delivery.

TXT (Text) Record: Stores arbitrary text information. These are widely used to verify domain ownership and for email security protocols like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to prevent spam.

NS (Name Server) Record: Tells the internet which DNS servers hold the actual, authoritative records for a specific domain zone.

SOA (Start of Authority) Record: Stores crucial administrative information about a DNS zone, such as when it was last updated and the email address of the administrator.

SRV (Service) Record: Specifies the exact location (port and target host) for specific network services, such as VoIP or messaging.

## you can see TTL and record of any Domain using 'dig'

**dig trainwithshubham.com**

inside answer section

ANSWER SECTION:
trainwithshubham.com.   300     IN      A       15.197.225.128

trainwithshubham.com.   300     IN      A       3.33.251.168

[Domain name] -------| [TTL]  |----| [Record] |-----[IP]------|

## Task 2: IP Addressing

IPV4(internet protocol version 4) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to a device on a network.

Public IP is assigned to the server for accesssing the internet and connecting outside the network. it is shared publically.

Private Ip is assigned to devices to communicate within a local area network with other devices. it is kept hidden

this all are private IP ranges-
10.x.x.x, 
172.16.x.x – 172.31.x.x, 
192.168.x.x

## Task 3: CIDR & Subnetting

**/24 mean 192.168.1.0/24 - it means that there will be 2^(32-24) = 256 ip addresses.**

out of which first IP is always network IP and cannot be used.

and last one is broadcast ip which also cannot be used.

## How many usable hosts in a /24? A /16? A /28?

/24 = 254

/16 = 65534

/28 = 14

# Explain in your own words: why do we subnet?

we use subnet because there are only 4.3 billion ip address in the world. we decided to move to IPV6 but it is so complicated that
we decided to shift back to IPV4. but with a different approach that is using subnet.
we create a subnet for a private network, now each subnet can have 4.3 billion IPs.

| CIDR | Subnet Mask      | Total IPs | Usable Hosts |
|------|------------------|-----------|--------------|
| /24  | 255.255.255.0/24 | 256       | 254          |
| /16  | 255.255.0.0/16   | 65536     | 65534        |
| /28  | 255.255.255.240  | 16        | 14           |


## Task 4: Ports – The Doors to Services
A port is a virtual communication endpoint that allows devices to differentiate in network traffic.

| Port | Service |
|------|---------|
| 22   | SSH     |
| 80   | HTTP    |
| 443  | HTTPS   |
| 53   | DNS     |
| 3306 | Mysql   |
| 6379 | Redis   |
| 27017|Mongo DB |

# 5: Putting It Together

You run curl http://myapp.com:8080 — what networking concepts from today are involved? **TCP handhsake**

Your app can't reach a database at 10.0.1.50:3306 — what would you check first?

**first step to check is if the port is istening "nc -zv 10.0.1.50 3306 "**

**second I will check if thee server is online using ping 10.0.1.50**
